## Stock Hawk - Project 3 for Udacity Android Nanodegree

In this project I updated a sample stock ticker app to add stock charting and an app widget to show stock quotes on the device home screen.

## Comments on the Project
- This was a good 'real world' project, I learned how to get, parse and chart financial data.
- I also learned how to do an AppWidget.
